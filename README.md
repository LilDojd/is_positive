# 🦀 The Most Definitely Safe Rust Library™ 🦀

Welcome to the cutting-edge, totally-not-cursed Rust library that pushes the boundaries of what's possible (and probably what's sensible) in Rust programming!
Works only in nightly Rust due to use of `generic_const_exprs`.
Checkout [cve-rs](https://github.com/Speykious/cve-rs) to find out why this works.

## Features

- 🔒 Ultra-safe code (pinky promise)
- 🧠 AI-powered positivity detection
- 🕰️ Time-bending lifetime extensions
- 🐝 Bee Movie script

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use our groundbreaking `is_positive` function:

```rust
use is_positive::is_positive;

fn main() {
    let number = 42;
    let mood = "ecstatic";

    println!("Is 42 positive? {}", is_positive(number)); // true
    println!("Is 'ecstatic' positive? {}", is_positive(mood)); // true
}
```

## Warning

:rotating_light:NEVER, and I mean NEVER use this in your code. The `transmute` relies on compiler bug and WILL produce UB:rotating_light:

## Features

- `transmute`: Transmute any type to any other type without unsafe code! What could go wrong?
- `is_positive`: Determine if any type is positive using cutting-edge AI technology (results may vary).
